# Obstacle-Avoiding-and-line-follower-robot-arduino-uno
This project involves the design and implementation
of a versatile robotic system capable of line following and obstacle
avoidance. Utilizing an Arduino Uno, 8051 microcontroller, IR
sensors, H-bridge motor driver (L293D), and HC-SR04 Ultra-
sonic Sonar sensor, we have constructed a smart robot car
capable of navigating through diverse scenarios. The robot’s
functionality includes following predefined paths, autonomously
avoiding obstacles, and adjusting its direction based on sensor
inputs. For testing purposes, a 9V battery was used, with 5V going
to the Arduino Uno and the remaining voltage to the motors.
This paper provides an overview of the project, detailing the
methodology, components used, and the working principles of
each functionality. Additionally, we present the connections and
usage of the L293D motor driver for efficient motor control. The
paper concludes with the successful demonstration of the robot’s
capabilities in controlled environments and discusses potential
future enhancements.
